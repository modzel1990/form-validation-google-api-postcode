## Technical Questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding test?  
~2h

2. What would you add to your solution given more time?  
For this particular task, nothing really. I would consider writing some tests and better checks, especially where
I do the call to the google API - as if result would be returned wrong for some reason, there is no coded action
that could consider this kind of scenario.

3. Are you familiar with Tailwind CSS, and comfortable to style up forms such as this on the frontend for systems?  
I've heard of Tailwind CSS and I feel that I could easily use it, seems quite easy to implement and straight forward,
nevertheless I've got more experience with bootstrap 4/5.

4. How would you test your solution, if this hasn't been implemented already?  
xDebug, old friend var_dump, return specific values from controller to see their output,
create own google account to use their api and test the implementation (which I've done).
Personally, I would love to implement TDD or PHP Unit testing.
